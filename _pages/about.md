# About myself....
I am Enrique Frias-Martinez, an applied researcher in Artificial Intelligence working on EdTech, LLMs/Generative AI applications for education, AI Ethics, urban computing and AI for Social Good. I strongly believe that AI is the next frontier for innovation and will change the way societies operate from an expert-base approach to a data-driven approach. Apart from research in AI I am also very interested in technology transfer and IPR, as the main means of producing a social impact from research results.

Currently I work as a Senior Researcher at UNIR-iTED (Research Institute for Innovation and Technology in Education, Universidad Internacional de La Rioja) focussing on defining policies and applications of AI and GenAI in learning environments, where I am also the Director of the [IBM-UNIR Chair on Data Science in Education](http://research.unir.net/ibmchair/?lang=en). From 2021 to 2023, I was the Director of the MSc in Data Science at Universidad Camilo Jose Cela (UCJC) and before that I worked for over a decade as an Applied AI Researcher at Telefonica I+D (Research and Development). I have a previous academic research live including positions in the Department of Biomedical Engineering of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in the Department of Information Systems & Computing of Brunel University London, and last by not least in the Department of Computer Science @ Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University.

I have received a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, where I was the recipient of the Best Ph.D. Thesis Award of the School of Computer Science. I also have a MSc in Biomedical Engineering from UCLA and a PhD in Information Systems from Brunel University London.
